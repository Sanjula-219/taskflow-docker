### Day 2: Application Development
**Goals:**
- Build basic Node.js REST API
- Implement 8-10 endpoints
- Set up MongoDB connection
- Test locally (without Docker)

**Endpoints to Build:**
1. GET /health - Health check
2. GET /api/projects - List all projects
3. GET /api/projects/:id - Get single project
4. POST /api/projects - Create project
5. PUT /api/projects/:id - Update project
6. GET /api/tasks - List all tasks
7. POST /api/tasks - Create task
8. PUT /api/tasks/:id - Update task status
9. GET /api/tasks/project/:projectId - Tasks by project
10. DELETE /api/tasks/:id - Delete task

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Application runs locally on port 3000
- [ ] All endpoints working
